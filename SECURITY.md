# Security Policy

TFWS itself is a document/specification, but we treat integrity as security-critical.

## Reporting issues
If you find a security issue affecting published artifacts, signatures, or reference implementation notes:
- Open an Issue marked as "security" OR contact maintainers via the repository contact (if provided).

## Scope
- Spec text integrity
- Release artifacts
- Reference implementation materials
