TFWS Agent Trust Verdict (Local Simulation)

Date (local): 2025-12-25
Repo: onetoo-tfws-ap-repo2
Root: .well-known/

Identity root:
- Public key extracted from .well-known/minisign.pub (RW…)
- Verified signing key match using minisign (secret key stored outside repo)

Level 1 (critical signature verification):
- Verified (k1-provider signatures):
  - .well-known/policy/bounds.json
  - .well-known/policy/current.json
  - .well-known/policy/policy.bundle.json

Level 2 (bundle inventory integrity):
- policy.bundle.json contains artifacts[] with sha256 for each policy artifact
- All artifacts sha256 matched local files after CRLF normalization
- Self-hash entry for policy.bundle.json was skipped (cyclic by design)

Level 3 (per-artifact signature verification):
- Verified all signatures referenced by artifacts[].sig_path (*.minisig)
- Result: 17/17 OK, 1 skipped (bundle self)

Incident & remediation summary:
- Initial issue: placeholder *.minisig signatures + CRLF (^M) in bundle paths caused verification failure.
- Fix: replace placeholder signatures with real minisign signatures and normalize CRLF.

Final verdict:
TRUST_ESTABLISHED + INVENTORY_CONSISTENT + ALL_ARTIFACT_SIGNATURES_VALID
