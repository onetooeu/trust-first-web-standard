# TFWS v1.x is Complete

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Series:** TFWS v1.x  
**Final tooling baseline:** v1.8.3  
**Effective date:** 2025-12-24

## Summary

TFWS v1.x represents a full, self-contained trust and governance baseline for publishing
static, auditable trust signals with cryptographic integrity.

This series delivers a complete, verifiable foundation that includes:
- stable canonical endpoints and durable URLs,
- hash inventories and integrity manifests,
- minisign-based signing and verification,
- policy snapshot publication and audit rails,
- changelog/incident rails for transparency.

## Finalization

With the publication of v1.8.3 and the closure documents in `docs/closure/`,
TFWS v1.x is considered **final** and **long-term frozen**.

Future work must start as **TFWS v2.x**.
