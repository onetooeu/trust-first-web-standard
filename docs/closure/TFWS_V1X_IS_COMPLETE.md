# TFWS v1.x is Complete

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Series:** Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS) v1.x (v1.0.0 through v1.8.3)  
**Effective date:** 2025-12-24  
**Repository:** `onetooeu/trust-first-web-standard`  
**Canonical closure:** `docs/closure/TRUST_CLOSURE_STATEMENT.md`  
**Long-term freeze policy:** `docs/closure/LONG_TERM_FROZEN.md`

## Summary

TFWS v1.x is declared **complete** and is now maintained under a **long-term frozen** policy.

This file exists as a short, high-visibility marker for auditors, integrators, and automated tooling.

## Practical implications

- If you implement TFWS, treat **v1.x semantics and verification rules as stable**.
- Expect **no backwards-affecting changes** within v1.x.
- Signed v1.x releases remain valid under the published public keys and verification procedure.

## Where to go next

All new functionality or behavior changes must start as **TFWS v2.x**, with explicit versioning and migration guidance.

## Sign-off

Issued by the TFWS maintainers for the TFWS v1.x series.
