# Press / Media Kit — ONETOO.eu

## One‑sentence summary
ONETOO.eu is a Pan‑European Trust & Decision Infrastructure for commerce and AI — transparent, explainable, and audit‑ready.

## What it is
ONETOO.eu helps people, platforms, and AI assistants make safer shopping decisions by providing trust signals, risk intelligence (with reason codes and confidence), and EU 27/27 jurisdiction context (EU core + national overrides).

## What it is not
- Not an e‑shop
- Not only a price comparison site
- Not a black‑box score

## Key facts
- Coverage: all EU member states (27/27) via a single EU framework with national overrides
- Public governance: signed and versioned data, AI governance endpoints, transparency reporting
- Business value: verified traffic (safe affiliate redirects), reduced reputational risk, compliance‑friendly integrations

## Typical use cases
- AI assistants: governance‑ready trust signals and explanations
- Comparison sites: trust overlay to protect brand and users
- Marketplaces: jurisdiction‑aware risk policy across multiple countries
- Partners: verified affiliate traffic with auditable logs
