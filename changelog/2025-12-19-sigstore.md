# 2025-12-19 — Supply-chain attestation (Sigstore)

- Added optional keyless Sigstore/Cosign CI job (`cosign-attest.yml`) that produces bundles with Rekor transparency-log inclusion proofs.
- Published endpoints:
  - `/.well-known/sigstore.json`
  - `/dumps/attestations/index.json`
- Updated verification page with cosign instructions.
- Added documentation: `docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md`.

Minisign remains the primary trust anchor for integrity.
