# Reputation policy (non-centralized)

OCP-MSG does not define a centralized reputation score.

Guiding principles:
- Agents compute and maintain reputation locally.
- Servers may enforce basic anti-abuse limits, but do not publish global rankings.
- Any reputation signals exchanged between agents should be signed and optional.
- Protocol stability comes first; reputation mechanisms must not require breaking API changes.
