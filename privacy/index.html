<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>ONETOO.eu (operated by <strong>ONETOO.dynamics</strong>) is built to minimize personal data processing.</p>
<h2>What we do not do</h2>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
<li>We do not require accounts for public endpoints.</li>
<li>We do not use invasive tracking for verified redirects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operational data</h2>
<p>For reliability and abuse prevention, we may process limited technical logs (e.g., timestamps, request volume, aggregated metrics). We aim to keep logs minimal and privacy-preserving.</p>
<h2>Affiliate transparency</h2>
<p>Where affiliate links are used, they are clearly labeled. Trust comes before monetization.</p>
