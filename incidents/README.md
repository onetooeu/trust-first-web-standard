# Incidents

This folder is the public incident log for **onetoo.eu**.

## How it works
- `index.json` is the machine-readable index (append-only).
- Each incident is a JSON file named like `INC-20251219-0001.json`.
- Prefer short, factual updates.

## No incidents?
Keep `index.json.items` empty. That's valid.
