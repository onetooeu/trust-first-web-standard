# Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS)
## Version 1.0 — Draft

Status: Draft  
License: CC0 1.0 Universal  
Scope: Vendor-neutral, implementation-agnostic

---

## 1. Abstract
The Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS) specifies a minimal, verifiable “trust surface” for web publishing.
TFWS defines mandatory machine-readable trust signals, cryptographic identity expectations, and durability
principles to enable reliable use by humans, automated agents, and auditors.

---

## 2. Goals
TFWS aims to:
- Provide explicit, machine-readable trust signals.
- Enable verifiable identity and integrity.
- Support long-term archival durability (decade-scale).
- Maintain parity between human and agent access to trust-relevant information.

---

## 3. Non-Goals
TFWS does not define:
- UI/UX design, branding, or content style
- business models
- programming languages or frameworks
- certification or centralized auditing

---

## 4. Normative Language
The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**
are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 5. Principles
### P1 — Explicitness
A TFWS-compliant site MUST publish trust-relevant policies and pointers explicitly.
### P2 — Verifiability
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD provide cryptographic mechanisms to verify integrity
and provenance of trust-critical statements.
### P3 — Determinism
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD be deployable as static assets with deterministic outputs.
### P4 — Human / Agent Parity
Trust-relevant disclosures MUST be accessible to both humans and automated agents.

### P5 — Durability
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD minimize dependencies that threaten long-term readability
or deployability.

---
## 6. Required Components (Core)
A TFWS-compliant site MUST publish the following components. “MUST” means the
asset exists at the specified path and returns a successful HTTP response.

### 6.1 /.well-known/llms.txt
Purpose: Provide a plain-text, agent-friendly summary of the site’s intent and
trust surface.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/.well-known/llms.txt`
- MUST be plain text (`text/plain`)
- SHOULD include pointers to the trust manifest and signing key

### 6.2 /.well-known/security.txt
Purpose: Provide a stable security contact and disclosure policy.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/.well-known/security.txt`
- MUST include a contact method (email or URL)
- SHOULD include an encryption key reference (optional)

### 6.3 /robots.txt
Purpose: Publish crawler directives and a canonical sitemap pointer.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/robots.txt`
- SHOULD reference `sitemap.xml`

### 6.4 /sitemap.xml
Purpose: Enumerate canonical URLs for discovery.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/sitemap.xml`
- SHOULD list all public pages and key trust endpoints

### 6.5 Trust manifest (machine-readable)
Purpose: A canonical, machine-readable declaration of trust-relevant facts.
