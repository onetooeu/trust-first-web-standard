# Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS)
## Version 1.0 — Draft

Status: Draft  
License: CC0 1.0 Universal  
Scope: Vendor-neutral, implementation-agnostic

## 1. Abstract
The Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS) specifies a minimal, verifiable “trust surface” for web publishing.
TFWS defines mandatory machine-readable trust signals, cryptographic identity expectations, and durability
principles to enable reliable use by humans, automated agents, and auditors.

---

## 2. Goals
TFWS aims to:
- Provide explicit, machine-readable trust signals.
- Enable verifiable identity and integrity.
- Support long-term archival durability (decade-scale).
- Maintain parity between human and agent access to trust-relevant information.

---

## 3. Non-Goals
TFWS does not define:
- UI/UX design, branding, or content style
- business models
- programming languages or frameworks
- certification or centralized auditing

---

## 4. Normative Language
The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**
are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 5. Principles
### P1 — Explicitness
A TFWS-compliant site MUST publish trust-relevant policies and pointers explicitly.
### P2 — Verifiability
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD provide cryptographic mechanisms to verify integrity
and provenance of trust-critical statements.
### P3 — Determinism
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD be deployable as static assets with deterministic outputs.
### P4 — Human / Agent Parity
Trust-relevant disclosures MUST be accessible to both humans and automated agents.

### P5 — Durability
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD minimize dependencies that threaten long-term readability
or deployability.
