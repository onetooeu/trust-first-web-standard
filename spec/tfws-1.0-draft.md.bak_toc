## 1. Abstract
The Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS) specifies a minimal, verifiable “trust surface” for web publishing.
TFWS defines mandatory machine-readable trust signals, cryptographic identity expectations, and durability
principles to enable reliable use by humans, automated agents, and auditors.

---

## 2. Goals
TFWS aims to:
- Provide explicit, machine-readable trust signals.
- Enable verifiable identity and integrity.
- Support long-term archival durability (decade-scale).
- Maintain parity between human and agent access to trust-relevant information.

---

## 3. Non-Goals
TFWS does not define:
- UI/UX design, branding, or content style
- business models
- programming languages or frameworks
- certification or centralized auditing

---

## 4. Normative Language
The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**
are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 5. Principles
### P1 — Explicitness
A TFWS-compliant site MUST publish trust-relevant policies and pointers explicitly.
### P2 — Verifiability
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD provide cryptographic mechanisms to verify integrity
and provenance of trust-critical statements.
### P3 — Determinism
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD be deployable as static assets with deterministic outputs.
### P4 — Human / Agent Parity
Trust-relevant disclosures MUST be accessible to both humans and automated agents.

### P5 — Durability
A TFWS-compliant site SHOULD minimize dependencies that threaten long-term readability
or deployability.

---
## 6. Required Components (Core)
A TFWS-compliant site MUST publish the following components. “MUST” means the
asset exists at the specified path and returns a successful HTTP response.

### 6.1 /.well-known/llms.txt
Purpose: Provide a plain-text, agent-friendly summary of the site’s intent and
trust surface.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/.well-known/llms.txt`
- MUST be plain text (`text/plain`)
- SHOULD include pointers to the trust manifest and signing key

### 6.2 /.well-known/security.txt
Purpose: Provide a stable security contact and disclosure policy.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/.well-known/security.txt`
- MUST include a contact method (email or URL)
- SHOULD include an encryption key reference (optional)

### 6.3 /robots.txt
Purpose: Publish crawler directives and a canonical sitemap pointer.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/robots.txt`
- SHOULD reference `sitemap.xml`

### 6.4 /sitemap.xml
Purpose: Enumerate canonical URLs for discovery.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/sitemap.xml`
- SHOULD list all public pages and key trust endpoints

### 6.5 Trust manifest (machine-readable)
Purpose: A canonical, machine-readable declaration of trust-relevant facts.
Minimum fields:
fields:
- schema_version
- project.name
- project.canonical_domain
- entrypoints (e.g., API index, trust hub)
- policies (privacy, security, transparency, terms)

Requirements:
- MUST be served at a stable URL
- Recommended location: `/.well-known/ai-trust-hub.json`
- SHOULD be versioned
- SHOULD be cryptographically signed (see §7)

---
## 7. Signing & Integrity

### 7.1 Public key
Purpose: Provide a stable, machine-discoverable signing key.
Requirements:
- MUST be served at `/.well-known/minisign.pub`
- MUST be plain text
- SHOULD be rotated via a published key-history mechanism (see Governance)

### 7.2 Signed artifacts
Purpose: Allow integrity verification of trust-critical statements and indexes.
Recommended artifacts to sign:
- Trust manifest JSON
- Transparency report(s)
- Release / index dumps (if provided)

Requirements:
- Each signed artifact MUST have a detached signature published alongside it.
- Recommended signature extension: `.minisig`

Example:
- `/dumps/release.json`
- `/dumps/release.json.minisig`

### 7.3 Hash index
Purpose: Provide a machine-readable mapping of artifacts to hashes.
Requirements:
- SHOULD publish a hash index (e.g., `sha256.json`)
- SHOULD sign the hash index

---
## 8. Compliance Profiles

### 8.1 TFWS-Core
A TFWS-Core site implements all requirements defined in §6 (Required Components).

Characteristics:
- Explicit trust endpoints
- Machine-readable policies
- Deterministic, auditable publishing surface

### 8.2 TFWS-Verified
A TFWS-Verified site implements TFWS-Core and adds cryptographic integrity
verification as defined in §7.

Additional characteristics:
- Signed trust manifest
- Published public signing key
- Hash index for verification

### 8.3 TFWS-Archival
A TFWS-Archival site implements TFWS-Verified and adds long-term durability and
archival guarantees.

Additional characteristics:
- Versioned historical records
- Key history and rotation documentation
- Minimal external dependencies

---
## 9. Governance
The Trust-First Web Standard (TFWS) is governed as an open, vendor-neutral
specification.

Governance principles:
- Open contribution via public issue tracking
- Transparent decision-making
- No single-vendor control
- Public versioned releases


## 10. Versioning
TFWS uses semantic versioning.

- MAJOR: Breaking changes to requirements
- MINOR: Backward-compatible additions or clarifications
- PATCH: Editorial fixes and errata

Draft versions MAY evolve without backward compatibility guarantees.


## 11. Security Considerations
TFWS reduces ambiguity by making trust statements explicit and verifiable.

Implementers SHOULD:
- Protect private signing keys
- Document key rotation and compromise procedures
- Avoid unverifiable trust claims
- Treat machine-readable trust data as security-critical


## 12. Conclusion
The Trust-First Web Standard defines a minimal, explicit trust surface for the web.

It does not prescribe technology stacks or business models.
It establishes a shared baseline for verifiable trust,
usable by humans and autonomous systems alike.
